# art-generator
JS program to randomly generate art.

## Getting Started
First of all download the repo as a zip. Then just extract the zip and you should be good.

## Different Folders
Each of the different folders have altered versions of the generator that act differently. Here are the differences:
 * Orderly - Places turtles on a grid. The turtles move and draw lines while changing color and direction.
 * Turny - Same as orderly but the turtles keep their direction from the last one.
 * Dynamic - These are versions of the others that do all of the drawing in different frames to keep the slowdown out.
 * Shifted - Same as orderly but every other column is shifted half a spot.
 
## Running the Generator
To run the generator, simply open the folder you want to use and open index.html. Pressing F creates the art, and to make a new one press F again.
